Documentation Style Used:
	
	We used our own custom version of JSDoc for function documentation

Implemented Functionality:

		- Game deals the appropriate number of cards
		- Verifies the correctness of player-identified sets
		- Replaces the identified cards with new ones
		- Keeps track of score to identify a winner
    - Graphical front-end
    - Timer to race against
		- Hint geneartor
			- Clicking on hint will inform the user how many sets there are on
        the board.
			- Clicking on find a set will highlight cards

Things of note:

  - Circle and rectangle cards are generated using pure html and css. The 
    only image used for them is for a stripes background. This left only
    9 images for all the triangle variations.
  - Timer pauses when viewing rules
  - Button shadow shortens when button is clicked.
  - Implemented javascript pop up window for rules and pause screen.
  - Game was not designed specifically for mobile, but we made sure that 
    it doesn't break for mobile.
  - HTML and CSS pass validation

Running Program Instructions:

  Open "index.html". Should be self explanitory from there. Our design was
  to make it simple so anyone could play without reading a readme file.

    Scoring:
    	- Each set earns three points
		  - Hint loses one point
    	- Showing a set loses three points
